      <h1>Jamia Masjid, Srinagar</h1>
      <hr />
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="intro">
        Jamia Masjid is a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Situated
        at Nowhatta in the middle of the Old City, the Mosque was commissioned
        by Sultan Sikandar in 1394 CE and completed in 1402 CE, at the behest of
        Mir Mohammad Hamadani, son of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, and is regarded
        as one of the most important mosques in Kashmir. The Mosque is located
        in Downtown which remains a central zone to the religio-political life
        in Srinagar. Thronged by Muslims every Friday, it is one of the prime
        tourist attractions of Srinagar.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="p1">
        The Jamia Masjid is heavily influenced by the Indo-Saracenic style of
        architecture and has been constructed in the Persian manner, with some
        similarities to the Buddhist pagodas. The structure occupies a total
        area of 384 x 381 feet and is quadrangular in shape with four turrets.
        These are in the middle of each side and covered with pyramidal roofs.
        All of the turrets are interconnected by spacious halls, with bright
        yellow poppies lining the mossy brick paths and the entire structure is
        surrounded by wide lanes on all four sides and has a square garden in
        the middle. The entrance on the southern side of the Mosque comprises a
        recessed portico which further leads onto an inner courtyard. This
        courtyard is based on the traditional Chaar Bagh plan and has a tank in
        the centre. The entire courtyard is made up of pointed arched, brick
        arcade. The court which was originally planted with a series of chinars
        is enclosed by arched liwans (cloisters) covered with two tiered sloping
        roof.

      <h2>In History</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Jamia Masjid has been a hot-bed of raging political discourse on the
        present turmoil in the state, and the politics that has unfolded in
        Kashmir has led to curbs and gags on congregations here. Its roots,
        however, lie deeper in history. The Mosque also became a platform for
        people to debate and discuss the politics of the Kashmir conflict much
        earlier before the conflict erupted in Kashmir valley.[5] According to
        historian Mohammad Ishaq Khan, “Jamia Masjid has primarily played a
        significant part in imparting religious education. However, with the
        spread of modern education among Kashmiri Muslims, thanks to the efforts
        of Mirwaiz Ghulam Rasul Shah, the Masjid began to play a seminal role in
        the growth of political consciousness. Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah was, in
        fact, initiated into what I would call the mysteries of Kashmiri Muslim
        politics at Jamia Masjid by Mirwaiz Muhammad Yusuf Shah.

      <h2>The Complex</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        On the western and eastern sides, the mosque is 381 feet (116 m) in
        length while the northern and southern sides are 384 feet (117 m) long.
        The inner courtyard measures 375 feet (114 m) x 370 feet (110 m) having
        a 33 feet (10 m) x 34 feet (10 m) water tank with a fountain flowing in
        the centre. Thus the space area of the Mosque is 146,000 square feet
        (13,600 m2). Its walls made of burnt bricks are over 4 feet (1.2 m)
        thick. The lower portion of the walls is made of rectangular stones.
        There are three big entrance gates on north, south and eastern sides of
        the Mosque confronting three turrets standing on lofty columns of deodar
        wood. The eastern side has a large entrance called the Shah Gate which
        is covered with a pyramidal roof surmounted by a square open pavilion
        (brangh) with a spire on top. A total of 378 wooden columns support the
        roof. Each turret is supported by eight lofty pillars 48 feet (15 m)
        high and 6 feet (1.8 m) in girth. The mihrab too has a similar turret
        over it. The remaining interior of the Mosque has 346 columns 21 feet
        (6.4 m) high and 5 feet (1.5 m) in girth. Initially the roof was covered
        with birch bark and clay. The western wall of the cloister has a mihrab
        made of black Kashmiri marble which is adorned with beautiful
        calligraphic work and has engraved on it ninety-nine attributes of
        Almighty Allah. The Mosque can hold 33,333 persons besides the Imam at a
        single prayer congregation.

      <h2>Reconstructions</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="first">
        <p class="first">
          The Mosque has been subject to much destruction till date due to the
          damage caused by fires. The Mosque was partially or completely
          destroyed by devastating fires thrice but was restored after every
          disaster. The existing construction was erected by Emperor Aurangzeb
          Alamgir in 1672 C.E. The reconstructions and major renovations in
          mosque's history have been conducted by:
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            Sultan Sikandar (r. 1389–1413 CE) in 1394 CE (796 AH): The Sultan
            commissioned the construction of the Mosque in 1394 CE and it was
            completed in 1402 CE.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sultan Hasan Shah (r. 1472–1484 CE) in 1480 CE (885 AH): The first
            fire that damaged it was in 1479, and the then ruler, Sultan Hasan
            Shah, immediately began the reconstruction work. He died before the
            repair work was done, and the task was taken over by Ibrahim Magre,
            the Commander-in-Chief of Kashmir forces under the rule of Muhammad
            Shah and Fateh Shah and completed it by 1503 CE.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jehangir (r. 1605–1627 CE) in 1620 CE (1083 AH): After facing
            another fatal destruction because of fire during the supremacy of
            Mughal Emperor Jehangir, the Mosque was re-constructed under an
            architect-historian based in Kashmir, namely, Malik Haider of
            Tsodur. The entire repair work took 17 years to complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aurangzeb Aalamgir (r. 1658–1707 CE) in 1672 CE: The third fire that
            distorted the structure was during the reign of Aurangzeb. It is
            said that when Aurangzeb heard about the accident, he only inquired
            if the chinars were safe, for 'the Mosque could be rebuilt in a
            short time. A full-grown chinar can never be replaced.' He got
            together all the bricklayers and masons of the city, and Jamia
            Masjid was restored within three years.
          </li>
